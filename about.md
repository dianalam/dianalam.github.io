Hi, I'm Diana. I'm an architect and urban strategist turned data scientist. I work at the intersection of design, economics, and public policy and am passionate about leveraging data and technology to strengthen innovation in cities.

I'm currently a data science fellow at [Metis](http://thisismetis.com), where I'm using machine learning and data visualization to uncover new trends and strategies in the realm of civic technology. This website documents the portfolio of data-driven projects I'm currently working on.

Prior to Metis, I was a Senior Analyst at [HR&A Advisors](http://hraadvisors.com), an industry leading economic development and public policy consulting firm. My practice focused on developing innovative economic and policy solutions to spur the growth of tech and innovation in cities. I managed projects and led analysis and strategy development for a range of public and private sector clients, including Airbnb, Industry City, The Related Companies, Knight Foundation, The Trust for Public Land, NYC Office of the Mayor, and NYC Economic Development Corporation.

I have a B.A. in Architecture, magna cum laude, from Princeton University.
