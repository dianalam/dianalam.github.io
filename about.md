Hi, I'm Diana ðŸ‘‹

I'm a data, machine learning, and natural language scientist who is passionate about developing data products for public good. 

I'm currently a [White House Presidential Innovation Fellow](https://presidentialinnovationfellows.gov/), where I'm completing a one year "tour of service" as an entrepreneur-in-residence. My work focuses on advancing the use of responsible AI/ML in the federal government and involves hands-on technical prototyping and policy development. 

Prior to PIF, I was a Lead Data/Machine Learning Scientist at Capital One, where I got the opportunity to work with vast amounts of transaction and banking data to create more personal, proactive, and predictive experiences for our 50 million plus credit card users. My portfolio included anomaly/fraud detection; customer behavioral modeling; and natural language processing, with a focus on understanding and information retrieval applications.

And before that, I was a Senior Analyst at [HR&A Advisors](http://hraadvisors.com), an industry leading economic development and public policy consulting firm. My practice focused on developing innovative economic and policy solutions to spur the growth of tech and innovation in cities. I led data-driven analysis, financial forecasting modeling, and strategy development for the public and private sectors; my clients included Airbnb, Industry City, The Related Companies, Knight Foundation, The Trust for Public Land, NYC Office of the Mayor, and NYC Economic Development Corporation.

In my spare time, I volunteer with [DataKind](https://www.datakind.org/), where I lead pro bono data science projects with non-profits, help scope new engagements, and serve as an internal advisor within their Centers of Excellence. My work on mapping housing loss in the United States served as the backbone for New America's policy recommendations in their recent [Displaced in America](https://www.newamerica.org/future-land-housing/reports/displaced-america/) report. 

I have a B.A. in Architecture, magna cum laude, from Princeton University.
