Hi, I'm Diana. I'm an architect and urban strategist turned data scientist. I work at the intersection of design, economics, and public policy and am passionate about leveraging data and technology to make cities more livable.

I'm currently a Senior Data Scientist at Capital One, where I use machine learning and customer data to create more personal, proactive, and predictive experiences for our 50 million plus credit card users. I build predictive models that focus on anomaly/fraud detection, customer behaviors, and natural language processing.

Prior to Capital One, I was a data science fellow at [Metis](http://thisismetis.com), where I used machine learning and data visualization to uncover new trends and strategies in the realm of civic technology. And before that, I was a Senior Analyst at [HR&A Advisors](http://hraadvisors.com), an industry leading economic development and public policy consulting firm. My practice focused on developing innovative economic and policy solutions to spur the growth of tech and innovation in cities. I led analysis and strategy development for the public and private sectors; my clients included Airbnb, Industry City, The Related Companies, Knight Foundation, The Trust for Public Land, NYC Office of the Mayor, and NYC Economic Development Corporation.

I have a B.A. in Architecture, magna cum laude, from Princeton University.
